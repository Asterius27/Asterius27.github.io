# **About Me**

Hi, Iâ€™m {{ site.author.name }}, a doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.unive.it/">Ca' Foscari University of Venice</a>. I work on all things web security, currently focusing on modern web authentication and authorization implementations, such as automating the signup and login processes of modern web applications to enable more in-depth automated security vulnerability assessments. I am also applying formal methods to web security to formally prove the security of existing policies and defenses, and to refine or strengthen empirical attack techniques.
